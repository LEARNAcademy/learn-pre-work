### Module 1: Intro to JavaScript ###
JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language. It was created in 1995 so it's an old, well documented programming language. Java and JavaScript are not the same language! JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page and when a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser (chrome) and it's up to the browser to do something with it.
