## Intro to CSS

**1. What's CSS?**

CSS, or Cascading Stylesheets, hold all the code that makes your webpage beautiful! If HTML is the skeleton and JavaScript is the muscular system, CSS is the skin! It is the outer appearance of our program. The following are some really beautiful web pages:

You can be as creative as you want with CSS, the sky is the limit. But first, let's start with the basics.

**2. CSS Syntax**

The syntax for a CSS file is as follows:

```css
body {                          /* A reference to the section you are styling followed by opening brace */
  background-color: #fff88f,     /* Styling written in key:value pairs followed by a comma */
  color: pink                   
}                               /* Closing brace */
```
Here we are saying, "Every element in the `body` tag will have a yellow background color and pink font color." But what the heck is a `key:value` pair?? A _key:value_ pair in CSS code is a protected keyword (such as `color`, which represents font color) followed by a colon, and the value you'd like to apply (in this case, the protected color word `pink`).

Like HTML, there are a ton of styling referneces to use in your key:value pairs and they do not need to be memorized. Here's a list of them!

Don't worry too much on the content of the CSS styling here. Just know that this basic syntax will apply to all of the elements that you end up styling. You can have as many lines of styling code as you'd like within the curly braces.
