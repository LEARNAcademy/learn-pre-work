## HTML Lecture Content

**1. History of HTML**

Hyper Text Markup Language: structure and content of a page. Not the styling, not the functionality. Basically the skeleton.
In the early days of the internet, there was no standardized way of sending information and documents. Internet was mostly used for communication between colleges and universities as well as the military. If I wanted any formatting to happen with my document, I needed to be able to break that down to smaller pieces. Thus, HTML was made to handle it around 1989/1990.
Some headers, some things are bolded or important italicized, some bullet points, bigger and smaller text, etc
Eventually moved onto more broad uses. Remember myspace? Probably used HTML/CSS to edit your page

**2. What is a tag?**

HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content. HTML tags typically fall into the following format:

There are hundreds of tags in HTML! You can look to MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) ar W3 Schools to see all of the tags available. Don't feel obligated by any means to memorize these. There are a few that you will use often (div, h1, p, etc.) and some that you will likely never use! At this point, just get familiar with the anatomy of a typical HTML tag.

**3. HTML Boiler Plate**

In your text editor (Atom of VS Code), if you type `HTML` and hit `tab`, the text editor will generate an HTML boiler plate. Let's break down what it is you're looking at in the boiler plate:

It is important to understand what each tag in the boiler plate if responsible for! But for now, we will be working inside of the `body` tag.

*Developer Note: our in-app text editor will already be set to "HTML" where necessary. This is purely for their own knowledge. We are not spending a lot of time on the boiler plate, we just want to introduce it. Tags, indentation, and attributes are going to be a much larger chunk of the HTML pre-work.*
