## HTML Lecture Content

**History of HTML**

Hyper Text Markup Language: structure and content of a page. Not the styling, not the functionality. Basically the skeleton.
In the early days of the internet, there was no standardized way of sending information and documents. Internet was mostly used for communication between colleges and universities as well as the military. If I wanted any formatting to happen with my document, I needed to be able to break that down to smaller pieces. Thus, HTML was made to handle it around 1989/1990.
Some headers, some things are bolded or important italicized, some bullet points, bigger and smaller text, etc
Eventually moved onto more broad uses. Remember myspace? Probably used HTML/CSS to edit your page

**What is a tag?**

There are hundreds of tags in HTML! You can look to MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) ar W3 Schools to see all of the tags available. Don't feel obligated by any means to memorize these. There are a few that you will use often (div, h1, p, etc.) and some that you will likely never use! At this point, just get familiar with the anatomy of a typical HTML tag.
