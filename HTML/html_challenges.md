**4. Practice with attributes**

- Create your first link! Write code that will link a user to the wikipedia site for Cholula hot sauce
```
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholula_Hot_Sauce">More about Cholula!</a>
```
_Developer note: you can check their solution by ensuring they have the same opening and closing tags as above. The inner HTML that they submit is arbitrary_

- Change the font colors below. First paragraph yellow, second paragraph blue, third paragraph red.
```
<p>Yellow is a star, yellow is the sun, yellow is the moon when the day is done</p>
<p>Blue is the ocean, blue is the sky, blue is the berries i put in my pie</p>
<p>Red is an apple, red is a cherry, red is a rose, and a ripe strawberry</p>
```

**5. Table Challenge**

Code the table below. Hint! You will need to do a little bit of research on `<th>` instead of `<td>`:
